# Super_Store_Tableau_Project

Objective- Analysing the store's performance across several categories and areas is the goal of the Super Store project. Through the use of Tableau's data visualisation tools, the initiative seeks to offer insights into sales and profit trends. Certain objectives consist of: 
• Examining Profit and Sales Metrics: Establish parameters and compute the corresponding fields for profit and sales. 
Analyse sales and profits according to categories and regions. 
Analyse the profitability of each state and city separately. 
• Applying thorough data filters will allow for a more in-depth study. 
• Creation of the Dashboard: Create an eye-catching and educational dashboard. 
• Forecasting Sales: Utilising past data, forecast future sales and compute possible profit margins and sales growth. 


Steps to Create Project
Make Calculated Fields and Parameters 
We can examine several situations interactively by setting criteria for profit and sales. To extract useful metrics from the raw data, utilise the calculated fields. Profitability is illustrated clearly, for example, when one looks at the profit calculation, which is based on the difference between sales and cost. 

Examination by Region and Category 
Finding out how various segments affect overall performance can be facilitated by conducting data analysis by category and location. It's simple to compare various locations and categories when profit and sales are displayed using bar charts. 

State and City Examination 
A more detailed examination is possible by dividing the data by state and city. Geographic distribution is displayed in a map visualisation of profit by state, while top-performing cities are highlighted in a bar chart of profit by city. 

Using Data Filters 
The dashboard's interactive filters improve its usability by enabling users to delve deeper into particular data segments. For personalised analysis and decision-making, this functionality is crucial. 

Establishing the Dashboard 
All of the visualisations are combined into a single, cohesive picture on the dashboard. By include interactive components like filters and legends, we make sure the dashboard is both user-friendly and educational. 

Forecasting Future Revenue and Earnings 
We can forecast future sales and profit by using historical data. We simulate possible future situations by using a percentage increase parameter, which offers insightful information for strategy and planning.
To find the predicted growth percentage, enter the formula [Sales Calculation] * (1 + [Percentage growth Parameter]), where [Percentage Increase Parameter] is a user-defined parameter. 
• Make a calculated field for anticipated earnings. 
• Put [Profit Calculation] * (1 + [Percentage Increase Parameter]] into the formula. 

These are the visualisations: 
Bar Chart: Sales and Profit by Region Bar Chart: Sales and Profit by Category Map: Sales and Profit by State Bar Chart: Sales and Profit by City Line Chart: Expected Sales and Profit.
